## Goals (or ideas)

1. Who are the Top 10 artists based on the number of songs on the charts?
2. Rank artists by the most number 1 hits
  - Do the same, but since you were born. Or the most recent 10 years. Or during the years you were in high school.
3. Rank artists by the most Top 10 hits?
4. Pick an artist you like that has more than five hits:
  - Make a table that shows the songs, the number of weeks on the chart, the top position that song had. Arrange it by most number of weeks on the chart.
  - Make a bar chart of just the songs and number of weeks on the chart, arranged with highest on top.
  - Make a point chart that shows the top 5 songs and the week the were on the charts and their position that week.
