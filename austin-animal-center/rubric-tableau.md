# Exploring Austin Animal Center intakes

See the [README](README.md) for more on downloading the data properly.

## Your quest

Use Tableau to explore five+ years of animal intake data to find insights that might lead to a story. You'll make a bunch of charts, including one that has been cleaned up for publishing.

Note that this assignment is not outlined step-by-step. You might have to experiment to get these answers.

## Assignment details

### Questions to explore

Use Tableau sheets/charts to find answers to the following questions, and explore others on your own:

- Over the past five FULL years, what is the trend of the number of animals entering the facility?
  - A bar chart based on number of records and the year.
  - Filter out the partial year.
- Are there monthly trends to intakes? i.e., are seasonal trends?
  - Again a bar chart, but this time by combining months to show all intakes in January, etc. Again, filter out the most recent year.
  - You should also make a monthly chart that shows all months of all years to make sure one year doesn't skew results.)
- How do those monthly trends differ by animal type?
  - Same as above, but make it a line chart with animal type on color.
- How do the months in the current year compare to the same time period in previous years?
  - Filter out the months you don't have in the most recent year. i.e., if you have just Jan-Sept of 2019, then filter out Oct-Dec.
- Explore other columns to find at least two more ways to look at the data.

### Create a publishable chart

Choose one of the charts you've built in your exploration and "finish" it out by providing headlines, sourcing and all those things outlined in the [Good charts lecture](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EMEIdUqeK94swrm0VvwPPBqzk5zSZqJmKnkckS2KFiw).

You may find that putting your chart on a dashboard will give you more flexibility to deal with text, legends and the like.

Keep all your other charts in the workbook, but clean up just the one. Include the name of the sheet or dashboard when you turn it in.

## Stuff to turn in

Turn in the following:

- Your Tableau project, which you need to **export as a Packaged Workbook**. You'll find this under File > Export Packaged Workbook. The resulting file should have a .tbwx extension. Turn this into Canvas. (50 pts)
- Your finished chart: In a comment on the assignment, tell me which sheet has your "finished" chart. (50 pts)
