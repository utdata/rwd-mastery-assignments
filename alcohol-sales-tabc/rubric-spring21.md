# Final project (Spring 2021)

> This final project for Spring 2021 Reporting with Data is adjusted in light of the mid-February weather event, COVID-19, social distancing and our compressed schedule.

## Deliverables

These portions are due **Friday, May 7**.

### The story

(300 points)

You'll produce an **800-word news story** drawn from supplied data sets and either pre-recorded or class interviews. If you wish, you may include additional on-the-record sources you interview but it is not required. Use Google Docs and share it with me as an editor. Don't pad your story with fluff. Instead, find another fact or quote to support your story. I'll count off way more for padding than for being short. Stay focused on the story and don't editorialize or pontificate. This should be a news story, not a personalized blog post.

**Include a compelling, news-focused headline for your story.** (50 points off if you skip or mail it in.)

### The analysis

(200 points)

- You'll turn in any **analysis work** you've done (Workbench, Datawrapper, other charting tools), regardless if it is used in the story. I want all your work.
- You will need to keep a **data diary** to log your downloads, source contacts and any analysis notes not otherwise kept in Workbench annotations. Use Google Docs and files uploaded into Google Drive and shared to me.

### The visualizations

(200 points total)

You'll produce at least **two publishable charts**  to go with your story using the tool of your choice. This chart needs to have a proper headline, description, legend, annotations and such so that the chart _can be understood outside the context of the story_. Include a screenshot and/or link in your story.

### Supporting elements

(100 points total)

- **Two promotional tweets**, one geared toward the story and one geared toward a chart. You don't have to actually tweet the results, just put them in a Google Doc. _Include an image_ that might help draw attention to your tweet. This can be in your story file. (25 points each)
- A **diversity statement** about how you did or could better add diversity of voice to your story. Can also be included with your story file. (50 points each)

### Peer edits

There are several points where you turn in updates on your peer editing.

## Process deadlines

In addition to the final deadlines and assignment listed above, there are several process assignments and deadlines throughout the month:

- **Friday, April 12**: When we start this project. I'll outline everything and answer questions, etc.
- **Friday, April 16**: Cleaned data and 1st peer check-in. You'll need to download both datasets, import them into Workbench and clean any data types, etc. You might use different Workflows for each data set. (You can merge them later, if needed.) You'll do your first peer check-in to make sure you and your partner have differing angles.
- **Friday, April 23**: Analysis check-in and 2nd peer check-in. You'll turn in your Workbench links and any other work you've done to date. You also check in with your editing partner, offer each other feedback and turn it in.
- **Friday, April 30**: Chart drafts due and 3rd peer check-in. The charts do not have to be finished, but you should have plots that show the data you are trying to communicate so I can give you some feedback. Your partner should also look over this and give suggestions before you turn it in as part of the 3rd peer check-in.
- **Wednesday, May 5**: Peer edits on stories due. This means you need a draft of your story _BEFORE THIS DATE_ for your peer editor to look at.
- **Friday, May 7**: Final project is due. Turn in your Google Drive Folder link with story and all your supplementary material as described here.

## Source materials

Here is what you will have to work with.

### Interviews

> See Canvas Weekly Guide for details and links to interviews.

We'll have three guests between the two classes. You are expected to attend if the interview is during your class.

- **Chad Womack** is a Downtown/Domain bar owner
- **Chris Porter** is the public information officer for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission
- **Andy Khan** is a West Campus bartender

### The data

You have two data sets to draw from:

- Monthly alcohol sales.
- TABC enforcement actions.

Directions to [download these data sets are here](README.md). You will explore the data using tools you've learned in class. You **DO NOT** have to use both sets in the story, but you do need to explore both of them.

> **TABC Enforcement actions**: While most of the violations we pulled in the data are self-explanatory, the item _585: Emergency actions_ is not. These are violations that since June 2020 were for violations of Governor Abbott's emergency coronavirus rules for wearing masks, social distancing and occupancy limits. Unfortunately, the violation data does not detail which rule was cited.

### Editing partners

> PARTNERS CANNOT HAVE THE SAME STORY ANGLE.

You'll will be assigned an editing partner to work with. Each week or so, you'll check in with each other and share your progress in a single group assignment. To be clear, YOU write about your PARTNER's project.

To turn in these "group" assignments, include the following in a Google Doc that is shared to me and submitted to Canvas with the following. Partners can use the same doc (it's one assignment):

- Your name.
- Your partner's name.
- A brief synopsis of their story angle.
- A description of the advice you offered them.

These do not have to be long ... just a sentence or two is fine.

The last check-in is all about you editing your partner's story. Make sure you have your OWN story in shape so your editor can look at it before the deadline. You might edit together in Google Docs over the phone or Zoom. I don't need to see the editing draft, just include that same type of info as above.

## Methods and deadlines

- Create a Google Drive folder and make me an EDITOR of that folder so I can see and edit everything inside.
- Write your story in Google Docs. You can include the supplementary material in the same file, but it does not count toward the word count.
- Include links to your visualizations on it's native platform. i.e., if you use Datawrapper, please include a link to the published chart.
  - If you are using Tableau, either publish it to Tableau Public or Export the Packaged Workbook and upload the .twbx file to Drive.
- Make sure any Workbench workflow is public or shared with me and a link is included in your story.

## How to tackle this project

First, take a look at this resource: [How to tackle a new data set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ql3NcPihfTsWb5qFxWIxthybpSvFh_cAcPuMi1McM_0/edit).

I suggest you use Workbench to clean, analyze and shape your data for Datawrapper or charting tool of your choice. (You can chart in Workbench for yourself, but your published graphic needs to be in Datawrapper, Flourish or some other tool that allows descriptions, annotations and the like.)

You might start by using Workbench to answer a series of questions. It is NOT REQUIRED that you find any of these specifically ... they are just ideas for you to work from or help you brainstorm for your own ideas.

### Alcohol sales data

- Which establishments have sold the most alcohol over the past five years? How does that look on a monthly basis? (Be sure to watch for multiple locations of the same name and name changes of the same location.)
  - Perhaps take the same idea but for a smaller geographic area. The Drag (Guadalupe between 19th and 30th). West Campus (78705). The Domain area (78758). Downtown (78701). SoCo (78704). East Austin (78702) and north of there (78722).
  - You could compare sales between popular areas. Or sales over time in a certain area.
- How did COVID-19 affect sales in 2020? Can you tell who might have offered to-go alcohol and how does that compare to last March/April/May? (Remember you'll have only partial data for the most recent months.)
- Is the number of restaurants or bars growing in certain areas? Like in east or south Austin? Again, ZIP codes might be a good geography to hone in on.
- How do sales break down by alcohol type? Who sold the most beer last year? Wine? Again, could break down by geography.
- How do sales change over the seasons around West Campus? What do establishments do to deal with that?
- How much does March mean to sales of alcohol downtown during SXSW? (Like what percentage of their yearly sales?) What was the difference in 2020 compared to 2019? (2021 data may not be complete.)
- What owner/company has sold the most alcohol? (Taxpayer name).
- Which or what percentage of establishments have out-of-state owners (or at least out of state taxpayer addresses)?

### TABC data

- Who has had the most TABC violations over the past five years?
  - What kind of violations (from among our data)?
  - What about violations near campus (78705)?
- How do bars guard against fake licenses? (as a possible angle on those who have had violations)
- How do TABC violations compare by ZIP code to alcohol sales by ZIP code?
- If you are looking at specific locations and their violations, an additional data point for your story might be how much alcohol they sold that year, which you could get from the alcohol data.
- For Spring 2021, we also pulled Emergency Order violations. We don't have details on which order the establishment violated (masks, social distancing, occupancy limits), but it could still be interesting. (I'm trying to get the emergency order detail documents from TABC through a PIR, but we'll see.)

### Notes on shaping data

When you want to make a chart from data, one of the more important aspects is to get your data in the right "shape" to support your chart. Here is how I go about that process:

- Draw a picture of what you want your chart to show.
  - What value you are plotting: Count of records, sum of some value, etc. There is almost always at least one Number value you need.
  - What categories are you showing? Different establishments? Months/Years?
  - Keep it simple. Good charts typically explain ONE thing.
- Check the [Datawrapper academy](https://academy.datawrapper.de/) and poke around the tutorials for your desired chart. They typically give an example of what your data should look like.
- Use Workbench to prepare your data for the right format. Some common functions and tips:
  - **Filter** will get you only the rows you need.
  - **Select columns** let's you select (or delete) columns so you have only what you need for the chart.
  - **Refine**: Allows you to rename values within a row. If I'm doing a chart by month, I will use **Formula** `=MONTH(date_col)` to create a new column with the number of the month, but then use **Refine** to change the names to something readable, like January.
  - **Group** and the aggregations that come with it are sometimes all you need to reshape your data.
  - **Reshape** allows you to extract values to make new columns for line charts. If you have your data where you have a column for "Year" with different values, you'll likely need to reshape it so you have a column for each year of data to do a line chart.
  - **Transpose** allows you to flip the axis of your data so rows become columns and vise versa. You can also do this within Datawrapper.
