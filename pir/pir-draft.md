# PIR draft to a new agency

For this assignment, you dream up a new data request for data from an agency subject to the Texas Public Information act. You will write the request and turn it in, but you are not required to file it with the agency.

## Requirements

- The request must be made to an entity subject to Texas Public Information laws. A state or city agency. NOT a federal agency or private entity.
- The data must not be available already in the format you are requesting. It could be that some information is available online but you want more fields, or as data instead of PDFs, etc. But let's talk about that if that is the case.
- Salary data is off limits, as it is the example.

Be sure to review [what makes a good data PIR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rU4VIPyFjVFWn01mhCyG-4fGHIIAaDzobJN1Yc_dA5I/edit#heading=h.1t2idypeepwn). The idea is for me to give you some feedback before you submit this the following week.

Be sure to include:

- How and who you are sending this request to. I want to know the agency and name of the person and a link to the online submission form if there is one.
- What you hope to gain from this request. What story might come from this?

Write this draft in a **Google Doc** and **give me editing access** and then submit the link to the assignment in Canvas.
