# Census county populations

## County estimates data

The file [ACSDT5Y2017.B03002.csv](ACSDT5Y2017.B03002.csv?raw=true) is an edit from table [B0302 HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Race%20and%20Ethnicity%20hispanic&lastDisplayedRow=20&table=B03002&tid=ACSDT1Y2017.B03002&t=Race%20and%20Ethnicity&hidePreview=true&g=0400000US48.050000) that removes the Margin of Error and some other columns for clarity and ease of the assignment.

> Note it is important to take margins of error into consideration with reporting census numbers. We'll cover that in later lessons.
