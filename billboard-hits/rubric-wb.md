# Billboard rubric for Workbench

Be sure to see the [README](README.md) for the source information and data dictionary.

## Connect to the data

To pull in the Billboard data into Workbench use the **Add from URL** option and use this link:

```
https://github.com/utdata/rwd-mastery-assignments/blob/master/billboard-hits/billboard.csv?raw=true
```

It will take several seconds to load.

## Your quest

As usual, each goal should be its own tab in Workbench. **Explain the goal/purpose of EACH STEP using the annotations within the tool.**

1. Review the data, clean up dates and save as a tab.
2. Who are the 10 artists that have spent the most weeks on the Top 100 chart?
    - Start the new sheet from the cleaned data. (Do this for all of them.)
    - Build a chart that shows the top performers and the number of weeks they've been on the charts. You'll need to Group and Count the rows first. Keep the top 10 performers.
3. Who had the most No. 1 hits?
    - This is not number of weeks with No. 1 hit, but the number of songs that reached No. 1. To get there you have to Group/Count Performers and Songs together, then Group/Count how many times the Performer is on that list.
4. Who had the most No. 1 hits when you were in high school?
    - Very similar to Goal 3 but with a data filter applied upstream in the workflow. You can copy the full year tab you made before and then add a filter upstream to show just the time period you were in high school. Include only those with more than one No. 1 hit.
5. Who had the most Top 10 hits overall?
    - Also similar to Goal 3 but you are looking for the artists who had the most songs in the Top 10.
6. What song was No. 1 for the most number of weeks?

## Write a data drop

A [Data Drop]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.k2b1zvdn1534)) is a short story that outlines your findings in readable sentences. It needs to read like a new story, but in this case won't have any sources beyond the data.

In this case (and this case only for this class) you can add some personal flavor in the story. Write this in Google Docs and include at least one chart chart from the Workbench. (You can upload the PNG into the Doc.)

Once complete, **Share** your Workbench project with my email and submit the private link along with and your Google Doc to the Canvas assignment.
