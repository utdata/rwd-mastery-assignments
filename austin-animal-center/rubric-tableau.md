# Exploring Austin Animal Center intakes

See the [README](README.md) for more on downloading the data properly.

## Your quest

Use Tableau to explore three+ years of animal intake data to find insights that might lead to a story. You'll write a [data drop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.k2b1zvdn1534) that includes interesting facts based on your findings. Keep a [data diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.5i6qymvlqkwj) to document your process.

## Questions to answer

- How many animals were brought in over past three years? (Note the partial year.)
- Is there a seasonal trend to intakes? (Again, deal with the partial year.)
- Are there columns in the data that are not in the right format?
    - What could you learn from them?
    - What steps might you take to fix them?
- Find at least three more ways to look at the data and and find facts you can glean from that look.

Use the facts you've learned to write a short [data drop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.k2b1zvdn1534). Concentrate on formulating sentences that include your data facts but are readable and relevant.

## Stuff to turn in

The items you'll turn in are:

- Export your Tableau project as a Packaged Workbook. You'll find this under File > Export Packaged Workbook. The resulting file should have a .tbwx extension. Turn this into Canvas.
- Turn in your data diary that documents your process.
- Turn in your data drop about what you learned.
