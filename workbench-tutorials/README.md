# Workbench tutorials assignment

Before arriving for the first class on Workbench you'll need to go through a number of tutorials. You will need to [create an account](https://workbenchdata.com/) first.

There are two types of lessons in Workbench, the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) and the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism). We'll work from both. There are 14 lessons that you need to do, but each one only takes five to 10 minutes.

Create a single Google Doc to collect all your results from each tutorial. Label them as you go along so I know which is which. Read the directions carefully as I ask for different things for various assignments. Be sure to share the Google Doc with me before submitting the URL to Canvas.

## Tutorials

From the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) section, do the first two lessons:

- **Tutorial I. Load public data and make a chart**:Â  In addition to the steps listed, add one more function before the chart to SORT by affordable_units in descending order, then refresh the chart. When you are done click on the ... button at top right and choose to Save as PNG. Upload the image to your Google Doc.
- **Tutorial II. Clean dirty data**: At the end of this tutorial, take a screenshot of your last screen and upload that to the Google Doc.

You are welcome to go through the other Tutorials if you wish, but they are not required.
