# Vaccination exceptions, Tableau

This assignment uses the vaccinations exemptions data that you [cleaned in the previous lesson](README.md) to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau that allows readers to explore this data over time by county.

You'll build three charts:

- A map of Texas counties that show the exemption rates by year.
- A bar chart that ranks counties by their rate.
- A line chart that shows the rate change over time for each county.

Interactive filters will be an important part of this dashboard.

- You don't want the yearly percentages to be added together on the map or bar charts, so create/use a filter by School Year that allows only a single year to be chosen at a time, and remove the "All" option. Have it apply to both the map and bar chart at the same time.
- Create a [Dashboard filter action](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) that filters the line chart based on a select of either the map or the bar chart.
- Create a Dashboard highlight action to highlight the map county based on selecting one from the bar chart.

### How to turn in

- Once you are done and saved, go under File to **Export packaged workbook** and submit the resulting `.twbx` file to the canvas assignment.
