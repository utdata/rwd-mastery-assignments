# Mixed Beverage/TABC Long Semester Assignment

Your goal is to make a short news story from one or both of two data sets available to you: Mixed Beverage Gross Receipts and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission enforcements for selling to a minor or an intoxicated person.

You'll need to [download these data sets](README.md) and explore them using tools you've learned in class. You **DO NOT** have to use both sets in the story. We'll discuss some story ideas in class.

- You'll produce an 500-word data drop based on the data. This should be written as a news story like most of our other data drops. 500 words is a goal, but don't pad your story. If it is shorter, just make sure it is a good story. You need three or so "facts" from the data to build a good case, and then support those with quotes. Then call it done. (100 points)
- You'll turn in any analysis work you've done (Workbench, Datawrapper, other charting tools), regardless if it is used in the story. I want _ALL_ of your work. (100 points)
- You'll produce at least one publishable chart to go with your story using the tool of your choice. This chart needs to have a proper headline, description, legend, annotations and such so that the chart **can be understood outside the context of the story**. Include a screenshot and/or link in your story. (100 points)
- You will be assigned an editing partner from the class to work with. You will each do your own story (and must have different angles), but the idea is you have someone to regularly talk with about your analysis, edit your story and proof-read your charts. At the end of the first week you have an assignment where you tell me your editing partner and angle they are looking at, and then another later where you discuss how you helped each other.

## Materials to work from

- You will have three recorded interviews from a previous class to work from. Links to the interviews are in Canvas.
  - **Chad Womack** is a Downtown/Domain bar owner
  - **Chris Porter** is the public information officer for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission
  - **Andy Khan** is a West Campus bartender
- You have two data sets to draw from: Alcohol sales and TABC enforcement actions (more on those below). You'll need to [download these data sets](README.md) and explore them using tools you've learned in class. You **DO NOT** have to use both sets in the story. See below for some story ideas.

## How to tackle this project

First, take a look at this resource: [How to tackle a new data set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ql3NcPihfTsWb5qFxWIxthybpSvFh_cAcPuMi1McM_0/edit).

Use Workbench to clean, explore and shape your data for Datawrapper. (You can chart in Workbench for yourself, but your published graphic needs to be in Datawrapper, Flourish or some other tool that allows descriptions, annotations and the like.)

You might start with a list of questions you might want to learn from the data. Answers to those might breed more questions. Listen to the interviews and you might find things to test assertions by the sources.

### Alcohol sales data

You have multiple years of monthly sales by location, including some breakdowns of those sales. You might compare geographies against each other or over time or both. Think about events in time to compare with.

### TABC data

Here you have common customer-centric alcohol violations for the same type of properties that are in the sales data. There are categories to explore and values to measure. You have geography, owner names, etc.

While you don't have to use both data sets in your story, there are some comparisons to be made or ways that each data set can bolster or add depth to findings in the other.
