# Other possible assignments

## Started or considered

- rwd-r-animal-outcomes is the beginning of something comparing Austin animal shelter data
- rwd-r-school-ratings-answers is our excel lesson in R
- opioids-centex-master in StatesmanRepo has Travis EMS data we could work. Could build what the [cdc has](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html), but it already exists onlien. 


## School data ideas

- Advanced courses from StatesmanRepo. 
- Gifted and Talented from TAPR. Would want many years

- Look through old stories
- A _quick_ campaign finance look. I started to collect stuff on Empower Texas (in projects), but I also pulled over a couple of other projects in StatesmanProjects
- Vaccinations?
- Weather data? How hot is hot?

## Socrata

- Demolitions from Construction Permits. Find by zip. Basically rework my story.
