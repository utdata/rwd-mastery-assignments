# Exploring Austin Animal Center intakes

See the [README](README.md) for more on downloading the data properly.

## Your quest

Use Tableau to explore five+ years of animal intake data to find insights that might lead to a story. You'll make a bunch of charts (including one worth publishing), write a [data drop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.k2b1zvdn1534) and keep a [data diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.5i6qymvlqkwj) to document your process.

## Assignment details

### Keep a Data Diary

Use a data diary to keep track of thoughts and record important steps as you work through the project. In addition to the [usual notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.5i6qymvlqkwj), also include this:

- Are there columns in the data that are not in the right format?
- What could you learn from those columns?
- What steps might you take to fix them?

### Questions to explore

Use Tableau sheets/charts to find answers to the following questions, and explore others on your own:

- Over the past five FULL years, what is the trend of the number of animals entering the facility? (Filter out the partial year.)
- Are there seasonal trends to intakes? (Again, deal with the partial year.)
- How do those seasonal trends differ by animal type?
- How do current year trends compare to the same time period in previous years?
- Find at least two more ways to look at the data and find facts you can use from that look. Include what you've found in your data diary and data drop.

### Write a data drop

Use the facts you've learned to write a short [data drop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.k2b1zvdn1534). In this case, the formulation of the sentences are more important than the flow of the story, but do write a news lede based on what you think is the most important/interesting fact you've found.

### Create a publishable chart

Choose one of the charts you've built in your exploration and "finish" it out by providing headlines, sourcing and all those things outlined in the [Good charts lecture](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EMEIdUqeK94swrm0VvwPPBqzk5zSZqJmKnkckS2KFiw). (You may find that putting your chart on a dashboard will give you more flexibility to deal with text, legends and the like.)

Keep all your other charts in the workbook, but clean up just the one. Include the name of the sheet or dashboard when you turn it in.

## Stuff to turn in

Turn in the following:

- Your Tableau project, which you need to **export as a Packaged Workbook**. You'll find this under File > Export Packaged Workbook. The resulting file should have a .tbwx extension. Turn this into Canvas. (50 pts)
- Your finished chart: In a comment on the assignment, tell me which sheet has your "finished" chart. (100 pts)
- Turn in your data diary that documents your process. (50 pts)
- Turn in your data drop about what you learned. (100 pts)
