# Workbench tutorials assignment

Before arriving for the class on Workbench you'll need to go through a number of tutorials. You will need to [create an account](https://workbenchdata.com/) first.

You might need to make multiple submissions to submit all the results. That is fine. I'll find them.

There are two types of lessons in Workbench, the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) and the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism). We'll work from both.

## Tutorials

From the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) section, do the first two lessons:

- **Tutorial I. Load public data and make a chart (5 mins)**.Â  In addition to the steps listed, add one more function before the chart to SORT by affordable_units in descending order, then refresh the chart. When you are done click on the ... button at top right and choose to Save as PNG. You'll upload the image to this assignment when you are done.
- **Tutorial II. Clean dirty data (5 mins).** At the end of this tutorial use the Export button and save the CSV url, which you will turn in.

You are welcome to go through the other Tutorials if you wish, but they are not required.

## Introduction to Data Journalism

In the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism) lessons, you'll work through all of them

- **First story (5 mins).** At the end of this module, choose the </> button and set it to Public. Copy the embed code and save it to turn in with this assignment.
