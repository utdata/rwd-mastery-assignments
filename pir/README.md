# Public information requests for data

A series of assignments for Reporting with Data. The assignments given will vary by semester.

## Fall 2021

There is one PIR assignment (beyond the lecture/quiz) scheduled for Fall 2021.

- [Write a PIR draft on an original idea](pir-draft-original.md). You have to think of your own idea and write the draft PIR for that data. You could earn the full 100 points on a _perfect_ assignment. See the rubric in Canvas.
