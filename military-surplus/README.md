# Military surplus transfers

The Defense Logistics Agency transfers surplus military equipment to local law enforcement through its [Law Enforcement Support Office](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/). They agency updates the data quarterly and the data in this lesson contains transfers through March 31, 2020. The cleaned data used here is from a [Buzzfeed Github Repo](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2020-06-leso-1033-transfers-since-ferguson) used for a [June 4, 2020 story](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johntemplon/police-departments-military-gear-1033-program) about the amount of equipment transferred since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri. There was a public outcry after "what appeared to be a massively disproportionate show of force during protests brought scrutiny to a federal program that transfers unused military equipment to local law enforcement." John Templon used the data to write an update on the program.
