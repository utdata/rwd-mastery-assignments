As promised here is some additional data that we pulled.  Attached are the following excel files:

 

·         District Summary

o   Count & percent A-F schools in districts with at least 7 schools

·         Grade Breakdown Over Time

·         Grade Breakdown Over Time High EcoDis

o   Both grade breakdown files are the count & percent of A-F schools 2016-2019 for Central TX and Texas

·         Region Change Over Time

·         Region Change Over Time High EcoDis

o   Both region change over time files are the percent of AB and DF schools 2016-2019 and the percentage points change in AB and DF schools since 2019 for all regions

·         Region Charter Performance

o   Count & percent quality & low-performing charters for all and high poverty charters

·         Region Magnet Performance

o   Count & percent quality & low-performing magnets for all and high poverty magnets

 

Interesting notes:

·         Of the 17 “large districts” (7+ schools) less than half (41%) have percent AB schools above the region and state average indicating there is some work to do

·         Of all the regions, for all schools, Central Texas made the least amount of growth in AB schools and the smallest decrease in DF schools

·         Of all the regions, for high poverty schools, Central Texas made negative progress in percent AB schools and the smallest decrease in DF schools

·         42% of all charter schools in Central Texas are high performing (AB) while 28% are low performing (DF); for majority low-income charters in Central Texas 30% are high performing (AB) and more than a third, 35% are low performing (DF)

·         Zero high quality magnets in Central Texas, 70% are low performing (DF) [meaning 30% (3) receive a C]; two of the four high poverty magnets are low performing

 

As we briefly discussed on the phone earlier this week the data demonstrates while the Central Texas region is on par with the state in terms of A and B schools the area as a whole has made less progress than other regions across the state. From the data it suggests that the region has had less focus or at least less success supporting majority low-income schools. From research in the Houston area and preliminary conversations with a few schools in other areas across the state some best practice we see happening in schools with high rates of low-income students are:

-          Schools that have a culture of high expectations and expect all students can and will learn

-          Use data to drive instruction (whether this is to determine how to pull small groups, identify who needs tutorials, which teachers need support teaching a specific concept)

-          Supporting the needs of the whole child (breakfast access, after school meals, healthcare access, a social worker or counselor that is available to meet nonacademic needs)

-          Intentional family and community engagement – communicating with families regularly, adjusting when and how they offer events or meetings based on what families need, bring in community partners that meet a specific need of the student(s)

-          Strong leaders that set the culture and the vision

-          The vast majority of these schools also have a pipeline of quality early education

 

I’m happy to chat about the data and what this means for the region further if that would be helpful.

 

Thank you,
