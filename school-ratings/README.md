# School accountability ratings

Each year the Texas Education Agency rates public schools based on test scores and other factors. This lesson is based on the 2018 ratings. You will download the data, find the answers to a series of questions and write a short "data drop" about what you learned.

> Note that in 2018 TEA debuted a nice reporting tool at [txschools.gov](https://txschools.gov/). We'll be looking into some questions that can't be answered with this tool alone.

This section will cover downloading and understanding the data. Below you'll find a link to the specified tool to use to find the answers.

- **Rename the downloaded file** to `CAMPRATE.csv` (vs the `.dat` extension).
