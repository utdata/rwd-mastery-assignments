# Working through Tableau tutorials

Tableau is a business analytics program, and as such most of the tutorials deal with business data. That's ok, because we use the same techniques when exploring journalistic data sets.

I feel Tableau has two strengths: It is easy to make charts to quickly explore data, and it is easy to make interactive charts that work together.

Tableau's mobile display is not particularly elegant or easy to manage, so I've used it less, but [I've used it plenty](https://public.tableau.com/profile/statcomdata#!/), [as](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ajc.sports#!/) [have](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pete.corson.ajc#!/) [other](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lanacion.com#!/) [journalists](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bo.mccready8742#!/).

There are gobs of training materials for learning Tableau, some video based and others more written tutorials. You may need to create a Tableau Public account to view the tutorials, but you'll need that anyway.

## Optional: Watch an explained data exploration

While this part isn't mandatory, you might benefit from watching this [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started?product=tableau_desktop%2Btableau_prep&version=tableau_desktop_2019_2%2Btableau_prep_2019_2_1&topic=getting_started) overview lesson that you might find useful because it walks through a lot of different steps in one video. I recommend watching it more to see more what Tableau can do instead of using it to learn every step. It's 25 minutes long. You do NOT have to turn in anything about this video. This is just one of many free [Tableau training videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training)

## Do this tutorial

Work through all eight steps of the [Get Started with Tableau Desktop](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-connect.htm) tutorial. Make sure you read all the "Learn More" dropdowns as you go through the lesson.

At the end of the tutorial, you'll publish your interactive to Tableau Public. Please turn in that resulting URL into the Canvas assignment.
