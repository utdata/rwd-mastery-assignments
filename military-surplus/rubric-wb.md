# Military surplus transfers for Workbench

Be sure to review the [README](README.md) to learn about the data and download it.

> This is a "mastery" assignment, which means you are applying skills learned in other assignments here without detailed direction.

Your charge with this assignment is to see how several local police agencies have benefited from the Defense Logistic Agency's Law Enforcement Support program over the past five years.

## The questions to answer

> Make sure you read the guidance below _before_ you start tackling these questions.

All answers should be based on data _after_ **Dec. 31, 2015**. This gives you at least five full years of data. In addition, only consider **Texas agencies** as you answer the following.

- Which departments have received the most equipment by value in Texas?
  - FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Are there agencies that stands out? It makes sense that Houston, the fourth largest city in the nation, would have a lot because of the sheer size. Who else has benefited? Anyone local?
- What is the **total number of items** and the **total value of equipment** transferred to each of the following local agencies:
  - Austin Police Department
  - Travis County Sheriff's Office
  - University of Texas System
- What are the **items**, their total quantity and total value shipped to **each local agency** listed above. i.e., for each agency should have their own tab with these values.
- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: What are some interesting items given to agencies? (You might have to Google them to figure out what they are.)
- Produce a Workbench Report that describes these values and embeds the results.

## Some guidance as you tackle this

- Have a single tab for importing and cleaning the data, then build new tabs from that using "Start from tab". Each tab typically has only one goal or "answer".
  - (You don't need tabs for "FOOD FOR THOUGHT" items. Just think on those as story ideas.)
- As noted in the [README](README.md), each row is a shipment of a particular type of equipment. The `quantity` is number of items shipped, and the `acquisition_value` is the value of ONE of those items. You have to create your own "Total" to get the value of all items for that shipment (i.e. row of data). You'll then use that new Total to get the answers sought above.
- Keep your tab names short. When you have lots of them, they get hard to see.
- When you get to your "last" step on a tap, make sure your money or "value" columns are formatted as currency.
- Make sure you use annotations for steps and the Report for your findings.

## Turning in the assignment

This is a two-part assignment.

### Turn in the Workbook

- Give your Workflow a name. Don't leave it Untitled. Include YOUR name in the title. Share the workflow with me and turn in the link.
- Also turn in the link to the report.

### Write a data drop

With this part of the assignment we are practicing writing sentences about the data and not a complete story. You do NOT need to explain the Ferguson angle with these few sentences. Just concentrate on how you would write the facts and attribution.

- Use Microsoft Word and upload the file to Canvas.
- Write a four paragraph data drop from the data. Be sure to include attribution about where the data came from. (Think of the original data source, not that it came from Buzzfeed. Links are in the README.)
- You can pick the angle from any of the questions outlined above, but each paragraph should be a description of what you found in the data.

Here is a **partial** example to give you an idea of what I'm looking for. (You can't use this angle ;-)).

> The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is flying high thanks to gifts of nearly $2.5 million worth of surplus U.S. Department of Defense equipment.

> Among the items transferred over the past seven years to the department was a $923,000 helicopter in October 2016 and related parts the following year, according to data from the Defense Logistics Agency data â€” the agency that handles the transfers.

> The sheriff's office has received the highest value of equipment among any law enforcement agency in Texas since August 2014.
