# Using OpenRefine

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a free, open source, powerful tool for working with messy data. Our most common use for it is to clean and transform data.

## Installation

While there is an OpenRefine application you launch, the program itself launches and uses your web browser for the interface.
