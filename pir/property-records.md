# PIR for property records

As part of an experiment with [The Accountability Project](), an option you have for the Fall 2019 Reporting with Data Public Information Request assignment is to negotiate for property tax records from a county in Texas.

You might consider this as the "easy way out". It likely won't work out that way.

Here are the steps to fulfill this request:

- Go to the [PIR County Property Tax](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hGayQZSNBAiasGsuor4c3ZWq_8vM37AZbSJ1iMSKHPA/edit#gid=1509171299) list and pick a county. **Add your name** to the `seeker` column to claim that county.
- Google to find "property tax appraisal district" website for your county.
- Scour the site to see if property tax data is available for download already.
  - You likely will find some kind of search for individual properties. That's not what we need: We want a bulk download for 2019 (and possibly other years).
  - The download could be called "certified rolls" or "appraisal data" or any number of things. If it is online, record the years and URL in the spreadsheet and then pick a new county and start over. Sorry and thanks.
- If the property tax rolls are NOT available for download online, then next is to find the person, form, email address or phone number of a person you can request the data from.
- Prepare a request (use Gooogle Docs) using a version of the request you will find below between the horizontal lines. **Make sure you update the template with the correct county name**.

Under the Texas Public Information Act, I'd like to request an electronic export (data) of property tax assessment records for COUNTY NAME for the 2019 assessment year.

Specifically, I'm seeking a spreadsheet, database or delimited text file(s) â€” not paper records or a PDF created from data. While we prefer a text export (.txt or .csv) we can receive the records in a variety of database formats and media (CD, DVD, ftp). Electronic tranfer is preferred.

In addition, please include any lookup tables and record layouts that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if fields are listed with codes linked to a separate table, we'll be happy to join the records ourselves, rather than require your staff to do so.

I want to stress that I'm not seeking any records that are prohibited from release either by statute or previous rulings by the Texas Attorney General or the courts. Please let me know if you feel any records in the fields I've requested are confidential, and I'll consider amending my request.

Also, please let me know if clarifying the request might speed the release of the data, reduce any programming time and, most importantly, avoid a referral to the Attorney General.

I seek this information in the public interest as a journalist, and not for a commercial purpose. Therefore, I'm requesting that you waive any fees, as allowed under the Act. If processing fees are required, please provide a breakdown of those costs before proceeding with the request.

In addition to the 2019 data, please also answer the following:

- How far back in time (which years) can you provide this data in the same electronic form?
- What other costs would be associated in requesting additional years of data?

- Turn in your request **along with information on who and where you'll send it** as the PIR Draft part of the assignment.
- Wait for feedback from the instructor.
- Incorporate the feedback and send the request.
- Keep records of all the dates and evidence of communications as indicated in the overall [PIR assignment](README.md). You'll turn in that documentation as the final phase.
- **But also**  update the `status` and `notes` column in the [PIR County Property Tax](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hGayQZSNBAiasGsuor4c3ZWq_8vM37AZbSJ1iMSKHPA/edit#gid=1509171299) so I an see there the general status of your request.
- If/when you get the data, get it to me.
