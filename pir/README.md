# Public information requests for data

A series of assignments for Reporting with Data. The assignments given will vary by semester.

## Fall 2020

There are two assignments to complete here, but in one of them you will have a choice.

- [PIR for Marijuana arrests](pir-drug-offenses.md). This is a group project where you will submit a PIR to a police agency and negotiate for the data. THIS ONE IS REQUIRED.

Of these two assignments, you do just one:

- [Write a PIR draft from a set scenario](pir-draft-scenario.md). The maximum points given for this easier assignment will be 89 points, if it is perfect.
- [Write a PIR draft on an original idea](pir-draft-original.md). You have to think of your own idea and write the draft PIR for that data. You could earn the full 100 points on a _perfect_ assignment.
