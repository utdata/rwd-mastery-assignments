# Military surplus transfers for Workbench

Be sure to review the [README](README.md) to learn about the data and download it.

> This is a "mastery" assignment, which means you are applying skills learned in other assignments here without detailed direction.

Your charge with this assignment is to see how several local police agencies have benefited from the Defense Logistic Agency's Law Enforcement Support program since 2010.

## The questions to answer

> Make sure you read the guidance below _before_ you start tackling these questions.

All answers should be based data from Jan. 1, 2010 to present. In addition, only consider **Texas agencies** as you answer the following.

- Which departments have received the most equipment by value in Texas?
  - Are there agencies that stands out?
- What is the **total number of items** and the **total value of equipment** transferred to each of the following local agencies:
  - Austin Police Department
  - Travis County Sheriff's Office
  - University of Texas System
- What is the quantity and total value of each **item** shipped to **each local agency** listed above. i.e., each agency should have their own tab that lists unique items, their total quantity and total value. Research some of the more interesting items in the list.
- What are some of the more recent acquisitions (most recent five years) for those agencies?

## Some guidance as you tackle this

- Use solid, repeatable practices we have used in class thus far, like a single tab for importing and cleaning the data, then build new tabs from that using "Start from tab". Each tab should have only one goal or "answer".
- As noted in the [README](README.md), each row is a shipment of a particular type of equipment. The `quantity` is number of items shipped, and the `acquisition_value` is the value of ONE of those items. You have to create your own "Total" to get the value of all items for that shipment (i.e. row of data). You'll then use that new Total to get the answers sought above.
- Keep your tab names short. When you have lots of them, they get hard to see.
- When you get to your "last" step on a tab, make sure your money or "value" columns are formatted as currency.
- Make sure you use annotations for Workbench steps and the Report option with descriptions for your findings.

## Turning in the assignment

This is a two-part assignment.

### Turn in the Workbook

- Give your Workflow a name. Don't leave it Untitled. Include YOUR name in the title. Share the workflow with me and turn in the link.
- Create a Workbench Report that describes each finding and embeds the results.

### Write a data drop

With this part of the assignment we are practicing writing a lede and "data sentences" about what you've found. You do need to source the data and briefly describe the program but this is not a fully-fleshed story. Just concentrate on how you would write the facts and attribution.

- Use Microsoft Word and upload the file to Canvas.
- Write a data drop from the data of between four and six paragrphs. Be sure to include attribution about where the data came from. (Links are in the README.)
- You can pick the lede angle from any of the questions outlined above. Eech additional paragraph should describe what you found from the data.

Here is a **partial** example to give you an idea of what I'm looking for. (You can't use this angle ;-)).

> The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is flying high thanks to gifts of nearly $2.5 million worth of surplus U.S. Department of Defense equipment.

> Among the items transferred over the past seven years to the department was a $923,000 helicopter in October 2016 and related parts the following year, according to data from the Defense Logistics Agency data â€” the agency that handles the transfers.

> The sheriff's office has received the highest value of equipment among any law enforcement agency in Texas since August 2014.
