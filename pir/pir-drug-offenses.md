# PIR for marijuana offenses

For this assignment you'll be submitting a public information request for marijuana-related arrests by various Texas law enforcement agencies. You will be assigned an agency and have to find out where to send the request. You will keep a log of your efforts to fulfill the request and hopefully in the end you'll get the data for use in a future project.

The steps are:

- **Get your agency.** Look at the PIR Assignment spreadsheet linked from the Canvas assignment and find your name. To the left you'll see the agency name and type you are assigned. If the type is "city" then it is a local police department. If it is "county" it is a county sheriff's department. There are also university and local school district police agencies in the list.
- **Find your agency PIR process.** You will have to do research to find out to whom you should make the request and how to contact them.
- **Submit the request.** At this point you will turn in an assignment outlining the process of how and to whom you submitted the request. **There is a Canvas assignment with a due date.**. Use the template provided below as a guide.
- **Keep a log.** You will need to follow up your request with phone calls, emails and such to make sure the request is understood by the agency. Keep a communication log of these efforts with date, type of action and any result.
- **Report on your progress.** After a number of weeks, you will submit a report about the process and results of your search. Your communication log will be part this assignment. **There is a Canvas assignment with a due date**.
- **Upload the raw data.** If your request is successful, I will provide steps to upload the raw data so it can be used for future classes. DON'T DO ANY PROCESSING ON THE DATA. Make a copy if you want to fiddle with it.
- (Maybe) Clean the data. There may be a later assignment to standardize the data so we can compare all the responding agencies.

## The PIR template

Under the Texas Public Information Act, I'd like to request an electronic export (data) of marijuana-related arrests from January 1, 2016 to the current date.

Specifically, I'm seeking a spreadsheet, database or delimited text file(s) â€” not paper records or a PDF created from data. A text export (.txt or .csv) and electronic transfer is preferred, but I can receive the records in a variety of database formats and media (CD, DVD, ftp). I can provide an upload link for electronic transfer, if necessary.

The fields I'm seeking for each arrest are:

- Incident number or other record ID
- Date of arrest
- Charge given
- Race/Ethnicity of suspect if known
- Gender if known
- Location of arrest
- City of arrest
- Zip Code of arrest
- Latitude if known
- Longitude if known

In addition, please include any lookup tables and record layouts that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if charges are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I'm happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.

If certain fields are unavailable, please sent what you have and let me know what was excluded.

I want to stress that I'm not seeking any records that are prohibited from release either by statute or previous rulings by the Texas Attorney General or the courts. Please let me know if you feel any records in the fields I've requested are confidential, and I'll consider amending my request.

Also, please let me know if clarifying the request might speed the release of the data, reduce any programming time and, most importantly, avoid a referral to the Attorney General.

I seek this information in the public interest as a journalist, and not for a commercial purpose. Therefore, I'm requesting that you waive any fees, as allowed under the Act. If processing fees are required, please provide a breakdown of those costs before proceeding with the request.
