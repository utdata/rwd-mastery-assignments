# DLA LESO for Workbench

Be sure to review the [README](README.md) to learn about the data and download it.

Your charge with this assignment is to see how several local police agencies have benefited from the Defense Logistic Agency's Law Enforcement Support program over the past five years.

## The questions to answer

All answers should be based on data _after_ **Dec. 31, 2014**. This gives you five full years of data plus the first quarter of 2020.

- Which departments have received the most equipment by value in the state?
  - FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Is there anything that stands out? It makes sense that Houston, the fourth largest city in the nation, would have a lot because of the sheer size. Who else has benefited? Anyone local?
- How many items and what is the total value of equipment transferred to each of the following local agencies (Think group and sum):
  - Austin Police Department
  - Travis County Sheriff's Office
  - University of Texas System
- What are the items, total quantity and total value shipped to **each** agency. i.e., make a group that:
  - groups by the item name
  - sums the quantity
  - sums the values
  - sorts by the most expensive
  - each agency group should be it's own tab
- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: What are some interesting items given to agencies? (You might have to Google them to figure out what they are.)

## Some guidance as you tackle this

- After you import the data, don't forget to filter it by the date. We only want records for 2015 forward.
- Have a single tab for importing and cleaning the data, then build new tabs from that using "Start from tab". Each tab typically has only one goal or "answer". (You don't need tabs for "FOOD FOR THOUGHT" items. Just think on those as story ideas.)
- Similarly, it might make sense to create tabs for each local agency that filters for that agency (started from the cleaned data). Then you can build subsequent tabs from the agency tab to find your answers.
- Keep your tab names short. You'll run out of room if you don't. (It's a bug.)
- The **Group** function and the **Sum** operations within it are your friend for this assignment.
- Format your "value" columns as currency, because it is money. Once you use a Group function you will have for format those values as currency again.
- Make sure you use annotations for your steps.

## Turning in the assignment

This is a two-part assignment.

### Turn in the Workbook

- Give your Workflow a name. Don't leave it Untitled.
- Share your workflow. Click on the **Share** button and set it like this:

### Write a short story

With this part of the assignment we are practicing writing sentences about the data and not a complete story. You don't need to explain the Ferguson angle with these few sentences. Just concentrate on how you would write the facts and attribution.

- Use Google Docs and be sure to share with me AS AN EDITOR.
- Be sure to turn in the URL to your Doc in the Canvas assignment.
- Write a four paragraph data drop from the data. Be sure to include attribution about where the data came from. (There are links in the README.)
- You can pick the angle from any of the questions outlined above, but each paragraph should be a description of what you found in the data.

Here is a two-graf example. (You can't use this one ;-).

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is flying high thanks to gifts of nearly $2.5 million worth of surplus U.S. Department of Defense equipment.

Among the items transferred over the past seven years to the department was a $923,000 helicopter in October 2016 and related parts the following year, according to data from the Defense Logistics Agency data â€” the agency that handles the transfers. The sheriff's office has received the highest value of equipment among any law enforcement agency in Texas since August 2014. Law enforcement agencies do not pay for the property but must pay for shipping the items as well as potential storage costs, according to the DLA.
