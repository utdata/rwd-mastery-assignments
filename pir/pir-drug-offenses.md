# PIR for marijuana offenses

For this assignment you'll be submitting a public information request for marijuana-related arrests by various Texas law enforcement agencies. You will be assigned an agency and have to find out where to send the request. You will keep a log of your efforts to fulfill the request and hopefully in the end you'll get the data for use in a future project.

## Project steps

### Part 1: Making the request

- **Get your agency.** Look at the PIR Assignment spreadsheet linked from the Canvas assignment and find your name. To the left you'll see the agency name and type you are assigned. If the type is "city" then it is a local police department. If it is "county" it is a county sheriff's department. There are also university agencies in the list.
- **Find your agency PIR process.** You will have to do research to find out to whom you should make the request and how to contact them.
- **Part 1: Submit the request. See Canvas assignment for due date.** Use the template provided below as a guide for your request. **For the Canvas assignment**, write a paragraph explaining the process that was required to submit your request, along with the contact information of the PIO or media office you will be dealing with.
- **Keep a log.** You will need to follow up your request with phone calls, emails and such to make sure the request is understood by the agency. Keep a communication log of these efforts with date, type of action and any result. **Stay on top of this and ask for help if they respond and you are not sure what to do next.** Keep all emails and other records, as you will submit those in the final report. Keep special attention to the 10-working-day rule that the agency has to get back to you.

### Part 2: Report on your progress

This is due later in the semester. **Check Canvas for the due date.**

Submit to the Canvas assignment a short summary about the process and results of your search. Include your communication log and copies of any correspondence. *Include in your summary any cost estimates from the agency.*

If your request is successful and you get the data, see below on how to upload it. DON'T DO ANY PROCESSING ON THE DATA. Make a copy if you want to fiddle with it.

## Following up on requests

### If the agency asks for money

If your agency is asking for money to complete the request, follow up with an email asking the following (or something like it):

> Thank you so much for providing the cost estimate for my request. While I realize not every agency is the same, many police departments in Texas have provided this information free of charge. Is there anything particular about this request that makes it costly? i.e., is there a way I could amend the request that would save agency time and cost?

And let me know when you do this. Don't delay ... we have limited time to fulfill these requests.

If the agency insists on a cost, get with me as we may be able to pay for the request.

Be sure to include all this information in your final report.

### If you receive the data

If you get data from your agency, please do the following:

- Create a folder with the name of your agency as it appeared in the assignment spreadsheet.
- Put your data inside the folder.
- Create a text file or .doc and save it inside the same folder.
- In the text file/doc, include the following information:
  - Your name
  - Your email (in case I have questions later)
  - The name of the agency you got the record from
  - The date you received the data
  - The contact information of the person who sent it to you
  - List any columns that were omitted from the data. (Actually open the file and look at the columns and compare them to the list of fields requested below.)
- Compress the folder into a zip file: [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files) | [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/compress-uncompress-files-folders-mac-mchlp2528/mac)
- Go to [this link](https://utexas.app.box.com/upload-widget/view/pzqdvci3ho8k78zxv6vxsll01a36sfmj/90157345456) and upload the zipped file.

## The PIR template

Under the Texas Public Information Act, I'd like to request an electronic export (data) of marijuana-related arrests from January 1, 2016 to the current date.

Specifically, I'm seeking a spreadsheet, database or delimited text file(s) â€” not paper records or a PDF created from data. A text export (.txt or .csv) and electronic transfer is preferred, but I can receive the records in a variety of database formats and media (CD, DVD, ftp). I can provide an upload link for electronic transfer, if necessary.

The fields I'm seeking for each arrest are:

- Incident number or other record ID
- Name of suspect if available
- Date of arrest
- Charge given
- Race/Ethnicity of suspect if known
- Gender if known
- Address of arrest
- City of arrest
- Zip Code of arrest
- Latitude if known
- Longitude if known

In addition, please include any lookup tables and record layouts that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if charges are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I'm happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.

If certain fields are unavailable, please send what you have and let me know what was excluded.

I want to stress that I'm not seeking any records that are prohibited from release either by statute or previous rulings by the Texas Attorney General or the courts. Please let me know if you feel any records in the fields I've requested are confidential, and I'll consider amending my request.

Also, please let me know if clarifying the request might speed the release of the data, reduce any programming time and, most importantly, avoid a referral to the Attorney General.

To save money and time I can provide a link to have this data transferred electronically. Please let me know if you need that link.

I seek this information in the public interest as a journalist, and not for a commercial purpose. Therefore, I'm requesting that you waive any fees, as allowed under the Act. If processing fees are required, please provide a breakdown of those costs before proceeding with the request.
