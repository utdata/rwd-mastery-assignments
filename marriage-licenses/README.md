# Marriage Licence data

This could be a fun project to try the "half your age plus 7" rule of dating, as outlined [in this story](https://www.austin360.com/entertainment/20170811/turns-out-most-texans-actually-follow-thehalf-your-age-plus-seven-marriage-rule).

The data is [available here](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vs/marriagedivorce/mindex.shtm).

I haven't downloaded it yet ... just a one-year example.
