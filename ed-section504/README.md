# Exploring Section 504 designations

The 2018-2019 school year is the first that the Texas Education Agency has reported the number and percentage of students who Section 504 accommodations for instruction.

This begins to explore that, but is not yet a class lesson.

I have some work in the Workbench workflow [Section 504 answers](https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/47591/).
