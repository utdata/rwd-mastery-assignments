# Billboard rubric for Workbench

Be sure to see the [README](README.md) for the source information and data dictionary.

## Connect to the data

To pull in the Billboard data into Workbench use the **Add from URL** option and use this link:

```
https://github.com/utdata/rwd-mastery-assignments/blob/master/billboard-hits/billboard.csv?raw=true
```

It will take several seconds to load.

## Your quest

As usual, each goal should be its own tab in Workbench. The goal of each step should be annotated within the tool.

1. Review the data, clean up dates and save as a tab.
2. Who are the 10 artists that have spent the most weeks on the Top 100 chart?
    - Build a chart that shows the top performers and the number of weeks they've been on the charts. You'll need to Group and Count the rows first.
3. Who had the most No. 1 hits?
    - This is not number of weeks with No. 1 hit, but the number of songs that reached No. 1. To get there you have to Group/Count Performers and Songs together, then Group/Count how many times the Performer is on that list.
4. Who had the most No. 1 hits when you were in high school?
    - Very similar to Goal 3 but with a data filter applied upstream in the workflow. You can use the full year that you started and graduated high school. Include only those with more than one No. 1 hit.
5. Who had the most Top 10 hits overall?
    - Also similar to Goal 3 but you are looking for the artists who had the most songs in the Top 10.
6. What song was No. 1 for the most number of weeks?

Once complete, share the URL of your Workbench project to the Canvas assignment.
