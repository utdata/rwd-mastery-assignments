# Preparing your next project

In addition to doing your final project for this class, you'll also prepare your next data project so you are up and running to include data in a new story for another class or publication.

This assignment is worth 200 points in the Final Project assignment grouping.

## Deliverables

- Find your raw data: This could be the result of your PIR assignment, or a completely new dataset you've found or already acquired. (You must have the data, not an idea for a new PIR.) This requirements opens up your possibilities to any data portal or data source from any branch of government or private source as long as you _have_ the data. Upload the data to Google Drive and share it with me. (If the file is too large, talk to me about alternatives.)
- Write a [story pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.2c0kjmnhvkas) based on the data source. This could of course change after you've explored the data (which is **NOT** part of this assignment), but you should have some idea of what you might gain from a future analysis.
- Include a list of three possible human sources **along with contact information**.
- Write a short description of how you would tackle the data. What tools would you use? What kind of aggregations or filtering/sorting might you pursue?
- Include all the written parts in a single Google Doc and share that with me. Include a link to the data.
