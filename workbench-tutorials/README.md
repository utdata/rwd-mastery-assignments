# Workbench tutorials assignment

Before arriving for the first class on Workbench you'll need to go through a number of tutorials. You will need to [create an account](https://workbenchdata.com/) first.

You might need to make multiple submissions to submit all the results. That is fine. I'll find them.

There are two types of lessons in Workbench, the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) and the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism). We'll work from both. There are 14 lessons that you need to do, but each one only takes five to 10 minutes.

Create a Google Doc to collect all your results from each tutorial. Label them as you go along so I know which is which. Read the directions carefully as I ask for different things for various assignments. Be sure to make the Doc viewable before sending me the URL.

## Tutorials

From the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) section, do the first two lessons:

- **Tutorial I. Load public data and make a chart**:Â  In addition to the steps listed, add one more function before the chart to SORT by affordable_units in descending order, then refresh the chart. When you are done click on the ... button at top right and choose to Save as PNG. Upload the image to your Google Doc.
- **Tutorial II. Clean dirty data**: At the end of this tutorial use the Export button and save the CSV url, which you will turn in.

You are welcome to go through the other Tutorials if you wish, but they are not required.

## Introduction to Data Journalism

In the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism) lessons, you'll work through all of them.

- **First story**: At the end of this module I want you to turn in the embed code instead of a PNG of the chart. Choose the </> button and set it to Public. Copy the embed code and save it to turn in with this assignment.
