# Preparing your next project

This assignment is either required or extra credit depending on the type of semester (long vs summer).

Include all the written parts in a single Google Doc and share that with me. Include a link to the data.

## Deliverables

- Find your raw data: This could be the result of a public information request or a completely new data set you've found or already acquired. (You must have the data in hand, not an idea for a new PIR.) This requirement opens up your possibilities to any data portal or data source from any branch of government or private source as long as you _have_ the data. Upload the data to Google Drive and share it with me. (If the file is too large, talk to me about alternatives.)
- Write a [story pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd5RR5YK43N3uE0o1vBoJfnkSo5S0JJFUCJmFsa75FM/edit#heading=h.2c0kjmnhvkas) based on the data source. This could of course change after you've explored the data (which is **NOT** part of this assignment), but you should have some idea of what you might gain from a future analysis.
- Include a list of three possible human sources **along with contact information**, and explain why you have chosen them.
- Include a diversity statement of how you your story might tell stories about diverse communities and include diverse voices.
- Write a short description of how you would tackle the data. What tools would you use? What kind of aggregations or filtering/sorting might you pursue?
