# PIR draft simulation

> This is not a current assignment unless otherwise instructed.

For this assignment you will write a public information request to practice getting all the necessary elements for the agency to respond thoroughly. DON'T send the request to the agency, just write the draft for me.

You should review the [Finding and requesting data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rU4VIPyFjVFWn01mhCyG-4fGHIIAaDzobJN1Yc_dA5I/edit#heading=h.1t2idypeepwn) document for tips on writing the PIR.

## The scenario

Hotel Occupancy Tax receipts are a public record that reports the amount of money a hotel takes in on room rentals, which the hotel pays taxes on. The data can lead to a number of stories: How much are hotels dependent on SXSW? How has COVID-19 affected business in 2020? Which hotels might be struggling?

This data used to be available online. However, in 2017 the Texas Legislature [passed a law](https://comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/open-data/hotel-receipts/) that prohibits publishing the data, though it remains available to the media through a public information request. You will write that request.

The hotels report quarterly and the main fields they are reporting include the time period (which quarter and year), the amount of total receipts (money for all the rooms), the amount of taxable receipts (money from rooms that is taxable) and the number of rooms at the hotel. But you also need to know who the owner is (the taxpayer) and what hotel it is (the location). Think about those fields as you write the request.

## The assignment

Write a public information request that would allow you to compare sales in the first quarter of 2020 to the last three full years.

- Figure out where you would send such a request and **include this information at the top of the draft**. A hint: The Texas Comptroller is the keeper of the records.
- Write the draft in a Google Doc and share it with the instructor AS AN EDITOR.
- Submit the link to the document to the Canvas assignment.
