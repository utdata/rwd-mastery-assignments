# School ratings for Google Sheets

> See the [main README](README.md) to see how to download the data.

We want to find a number of things from this data:
- What percentage of charter schools received a "Needs Improvement" rating, compared to traditional public schools.
- Which schools in Austin ISD received a "Needs Improvement" rating?
- Which schools in Region 13 received a "Needs Improvement" rating?
