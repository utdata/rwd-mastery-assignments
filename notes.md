## Notes about R

Some of these assignments are a companion to the book [Reporting with Data in R](https://utdata.github.io/rwd-r-reporting-with-data/). Some of those assignments might need updates as I adjust this repo for assignments in other tools.

## Other possible assignments

### Started or considered

- rwd-r-animal-outcomes is the beginning of something comparing Austin animal shelter data
- opioids-centex-master in StatesmanRepo has Travis EMS data we could work. Could build what the [cdc has](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html), but it already exists onlien. 


### Other ideas

- A _quick_ campaign finance look. I started to collect stuff on Empower Texas (in projects), but I also pulled over a couple of other projects in StatesmanProjects
- Vaccinations?
- Weather data? How hot is hot?

## Socrata

- Demolitions from Construction Permits. Find by zip. Basically rework my story.
- Restaurant scores?
- One week of dockless bike/scooter data?
