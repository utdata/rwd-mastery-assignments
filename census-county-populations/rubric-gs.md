# Rubric for Google Sheets assignment

The goal here is to find which counties in Texas have the highest population of a specific race. To do this, you'll need to create columns that find the percentage of the total for each race, then or sort by those columns to find the answers and write them out on a new sheet.

> Note that the margin of error columns have been removed from this dataset for clarity and ease. This is not normal practice, and we'll talk about it in class.

## Download the data

See the [main README.md](README.md) for more information on where the data came from.

- Download [the data](ACSDT5Y2017.B03002.csv?raw=true), then import it into a new Google Sheets file.
- As you import, choose NOT to convert to numbers. The `id` column should start with on or more `0`'s. If it doesn't, it's wrong.

## Create percentage columns

- Lock the header row and columns after the county name. I'll count off if you don't.
- For each race, create a new column that shows the percentage (to hundredths) of that race for each county.
- As you do so, use the `$` method to lock the `Total` column so you can copy the formula to additional columns. Points counted off if you don't.
- After you've added all the columns, sort by each percentage and find the county with the highest population for that race. Write those answers out on another sheet with the Race, County Name and Percentage. HINT: Cmd-option-V will paste values only.
- Share the sheet with me or make it viewable by all and submit the URL in canvas.
