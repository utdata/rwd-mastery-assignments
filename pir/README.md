# Public information requests for data

As part of this class you are required to submit a public information request. You are not graded on whether you actually get the data or not, but on the quality of the attempt.

## Requirements of the assignment

- The request must be made to an entity subject to Texas Public Information laws. A state or city agency. NOT a federal agency or private entity.
- The data must not be available already in the format you are requesting. It could be that some information is available online but you want more fields, or as data instead of PDFs, etc. But let's talk about that if that is the case.
- Salary data is off limits, as it is the example.
- I discourage you from filing against UT-Austin as they charge for everything. If you have a _GREAT_ idea, let's talk about it.

> NOTE FOR FALL 2019: If you are unable to come up with a suitable request, then you can pursue an alternative challenge of getting property tax records as [outlined here](property-records.md).

## Part 1: Start with the draft

This assignment is the draft of your Public Information Request for data that you will work on through the next month. Be sure to review [what makes a good data PIR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rU4VIPyFjVFWn01mhCyG-4fGHIIAaDzobJN1Yc_dA5I/edit#heading=h.1t2idypeepwn). The idea is for me to give you some feedback before you submit this the following week.

Write this draft in a Google Doc, give me editing access and then submit the link to the assignment in Canvas.

Be sure to include:

- How and who you are sending this request to. I want to know the agency and name of the person and a link to the online submission form if there is one.
- What you hope to gain from this request. What story might come from this?

### Submitting and tracking your request

After you get feedback from this assignment, track communications about the request:

- Save the date and time of the submission and any follow-ups that you can show me. Emails, screenshots, etc.
- Keep a log of all your follow-up emails, calls and other correspondence. You can do this in a Google Doc or Sheet ... whatever you are comfortable with. It should include dates, the method of communication, contact information, a description of the outcome, and the next steps to pursue.

### Some guidance

- Don't rely on email alone. Call the recipient and make sure they got the request, and ask to clarify anything they need.
- The agency has 10 _business_ days to respond. That does not mean they have to deliver data by then. But, if they have it, they are supposed to supply it "promptly, without delay". Check with them as the 10-day date approaches.
- Stress that you are trying to avoid referral to the Attorney General's office.

## Part 2: The final report

As part of the submission, you need:

- Copies of your original and any updated records request.
- The communication log of your efforts to get the data. 
- A summary of your efforts, which should include an updated list of possible storylines you might pursue with this data.
- Towards the end of the semester, you will present a 5-minute talk on your experience to the class. You don't need to prepare anything for the talk, just describe the experience and answer questions about it. Active participation in the discussion, both for your quest and your classmates' quests, is part of your grade.
