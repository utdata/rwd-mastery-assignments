# PIR draft to a new agency

> NOTE: This is one of two "either/or" assignments. You may choose to do this one, or the [alternative assignment](pir-draft-scenario.md), but do NOT do both. The alternative assignment is easier but has a maximum grade of 89. This one takes more effort but you can get the full 100 if it is perfect.

For this assignment, you will dream up a new data request for data from an agency subject to the Texas Public Information act. You will write the request and turn it in, but you are not required to file it with the agency. You'll be asked what you hope to gain from the request.

I recommend you think first about what you want to learn and then consider the agency that might collect a record on that subject.  Another way to go about it is to target a state agency and then look through their [records retention schedule](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/slrm/state/schedules) that lists data collected by each agency, but I find that mind-numbing.

Be sure to review [what makes a good data PIR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rU4VIPyFjVFWn01mhCyG-4fGHIIAaDzobJN1Yc_dA5I/edit#heading=h.1t2idypeepwn).

## Requirements

- The request must be made to an entity subject to Texas Public Information laws. A state or city agency. NOT a federal agency or private entity.
- The data must not be available online already in the format you are requesting. Actually look for it, as you can bet I will.
- Salary, other employee data and police records are off limits, as they are class examples.

Be sure to include:

- What you hope to gain from this request. What story might come from this?
- Reasoning on why the agency would have this data. Is it is a license or a form that is filled out or money exchanged hands? Something that leads you to believe this is a valid request to the correct agency.
- Where and how and to whom you would send this request to. I want to know the agency and name of the person and a link to the online submission form if there is one.
- And the actual public information request letter, of course.

Write this in a **Google Doc** and **give me editing access** and then submit the link to the assignment in Canvas.
