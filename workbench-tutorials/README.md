# Workbench tutorials assignment

Before starting on Workbench assignments you'll need to go through a number of tutorials. You will need to [create an account](https://workbenchdata.com/) first.

There are two types of lessons in Workbench, the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) and the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism). We'll work from both. There are 14 lessons that you need to do, but each one only takes five to 10 minutes.

Create a single Google Doc to collect all your results from each tutorial. Label them as you go along so I know which is which. Read the directions carefully as I ask for different things for various assignments. Be sure to share the Google Doc with me before submitting the URL to Canvas.

## Tutorials

From the [Tutorials](https://app.workbenchdata.com/lessons) section, do the first two lessons:

- **Tutorial I. Load public data and make a chart**:Â  In addition to the steps listed, add one more function before the chart to SORT by affordable_units in descending order, then refresh the chart. When you are done click on the ... button at top right and choose to Save as PNG. Upload the image to your Google Doc.
- **Tutorial II. Clean dirty data**: At the end of this tutorial, take a screenshot of your last screen and upload that to the Google Doc.

You are welcome to go through the other Tutorials if you wish, but they are not required.

## Introduction to Data Journalism

In the [Introduction to Data Journalism](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism) lessons, you'll work through all of them.

- **First story**: At the end of this module I want you to turn in the embed code instead of a PNG of the chart. Choose the </> button and set it to Public. Copy the embed code and paste it into your Google Doc. (You could use this embed in a content management system to display the chart, but I feel Workbench charts are not flexible enough for preparing for the public. We'll use Datawrapper for that later.)
- **Finding the largest CO2 producers**: At the end of this module, I want you to Export the csv file:
  - Click on the Export button
  - On the CSV portion, click the download arrow. The file will go to your Downloads folder.
  - In Google Drive, upload your CSV and then Share to "Anyone with the link".
  - Include the link in your Google Docs folder.
- **Column and line charts**: Make sure you choose at least 5 countries (or all of them!). Take a screenshot and upload it to the Google Doc.
- **Filtering data about public housing**: At the end of this assignment, take a screenshot of the last screen and upload it.
- **Grouping rows (pivot tables)**: When you make the chart at the end, make sure you give it a title. For this (and the rest of the graphics), save the chart as a PNG and upload it to your Google Doc.
- **Cleaning and analyzing campaign finance data**: When you make the chart at the end, make sure to give it a title. For this one, publish the PNG.
- **Introduction to data types**: At the end of this lesson, Take a screenshot of the last screen and add it your Google Doc.
- **Grouping by dates**: For the resulting line chart, give it a headline and add the PNG to your Google Doc.
- **Long vs Wide format**: Once your chart is done, give it a headline and add the PNG to the Google Doc.
- **Calculating per capita crime rates in the U.S.**: Take a screenshot of the last screen and add it to the Google Doc.
- **Comparing numbers**: Take a screenshot of the last screen and add it to the Google Doc.
- **Joining tables to adjust teacher salaries for inflation**: Take a screenshot of the last screen and add it to the Google Doc.

In class I'll answer any questions you might have about the lessons before we start working on new quests.
