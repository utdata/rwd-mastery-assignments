# Final Project (Long Semester)

> **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SPRING 2021:** This assignment is changing due to the mid-February winter weather event. Please see [this link for the new final project rubric](../alcohol-sales-tabc/rubric-spring21.md).

> **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR FALL SEMESTERS:** Thanksgiving week falls within this project period right about the time you might naturally be reaching out to sources. DON'T WAIT TO REACH OUT TO SOURCES. Make those contacts ASAP so you will know when you can reach them later, as they may not be available during the holiday.

This class aims to teach you how to use data to find and tell stories. It crescendos in the final month of class when you use the skills you learned during the semester to develop your own data-driven story.

Our aim is to be as transparent as possible, so you will use Workbench to clean and shape your data that will used for your findings, charts and visualizations.

The finished project will include the following:

## Story Pitch and raw data (100 points)

(Due four weeks out)

A story pitch with the following components:

- A description of your data and the story you hope to get from it.
- The actual raw data (links to the source site or saved to Google Drive or something I can get to.)
- Three possible sources, along with their contact information.
- A diversity statement: As journalists we want to always include a diverse range of people in our reporting. As such, I want you to consider the following as you report this story: How might I serve diverse communities and include diverse sources in my reporting and storytelling? You’ll also be asked how you met this goal when you turn in your final project.
- List your editing partner along with one sentence about their proposed project.

## Cleaned data (50 points)

(Three weeks out)

Cleaned data means one header row for each data file, correct data types and clean categorical values. I expect this to be imported and refined in Workbench. Share the workflow to my email as a collaborator.

## Analysis (50 points)

(Draft two weeks out)

Each "fact" you use in your story that is derived from your data should come from a Workbench tab or visualization. You will turn in all your analysis to me as a draft so I can provide feedback, and then again with the final project.

Start with a Google Doc:

- Write out each fact formatted as a sentence similar to this: The Beatles have more No. 1 hits in the Billboard Hot 100 than any other artist in history with 19. Mariah Carey is second with 15 hits.
- Each fact should then have a link to the Workbench sheet (and name of the tab) that finds the answer or a description and link to the chart that reveals the fact.

Be sure to share the Google Doc with me as an editor so I can provide feedback. Make the Workbench workflow publish through sharing and make sure the link is included in the Google Doc.

## Chart drafts (50 points)

(One week out)

You are expected to produce two publishable charts to support your story. For this assignment, I want you to have made good headway on both of them so I can provide feedback. You can use any of the following tools: Datawrapper, [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), [Fastcharts](https://fastcharts.io/), [Infogram](https://infogram.com/) or Tableau. If you want to use something else, talk to me first. (Workbench charts are fine for exploring, but don't give you enough control over display to use as a publishable chart.)

## Peer editing (50 points)

(During the last week)

While you should be checking in with your editing partner each week, you should take class time this last week to edit each other's story and charts. This means **you must have a rough draft of your story for your partner before that class begins**. (You should already have chart drafts from the above assignment, but have your partner look over those as well.) You'll turn in a summary of how you helped your partner after this session. So, you are graded on:

- Your submitted summary of the ways you've been able to help your partner. Include their name and a description of their story.

## Final Project due (800 points)

(Final due date. **Include all items in a Google Drive folder that I have editing access to.** The story should be in a Google Doc and all other items uploaded or linked from the story.)

### The story (400 points)

An 800-word news story (give or take 100 words) that is born from or heavily supported by your chosen data. Don’t pad a story just to make the minimum. Instead find more facts to include, do more reporting and add more voices. I’ll count off more for word-count padding than for being short. The story itself is worth 200 points, and the required items below add up to 200 additional points. You can include all of these items in the same document as your story.

- A headline that fits the story. (25 points)
- Three human sources that you have personally interviewed. Only one student is allowed toward the three unless otherwise approved in advance by the instructor. Properly credited published reports or studies (or quotes from such) are allowed as source material in your story, but they do not count toward your human source quota. Email correspondence with a source is allowed, but I encourage (implore, even) that you instead speak to your sources ~~in person or~~ on the phone. NO ANONYMOUS SOURCES. **Include a list of names, titles and contact information (emails and/or phone numbers) so I can contact them if necessary.** (100 points)
- A diversity statement that explains how you attempted to meet the goals you outlined above, and/or how you could do better. (25 points)
- Two tweet-length promotions to your story, one based on a character or text in the story, and one geared toward one of the graphics in your story. A good journalist is adept at promoting their own work. Write something I would WANT to click on. Use an image and hashtags and all the stuff you learned in your social media class. (You do not have to actually publish the tweet. You can write it in the story Google Doc or take a screen shot of the preview and include it.) (50 points)

### Finished charts (200 points)

Include the two finished charts that support your story. Include screenshots in your story with a link to online interactive versions if there are any. If you have a Tableau workbook, either publish it on Tableau Public or export as a Packaged Workbook and share in Drive.

### Analysis (200 points)

Turn in all your analysis work from Workbench, Datawrapper, Tableau or any other method that is not specifically shown in the finished charts used with the story.
