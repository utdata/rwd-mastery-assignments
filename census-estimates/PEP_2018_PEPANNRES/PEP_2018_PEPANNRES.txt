Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018 

Note:
The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See Geographic Terms and Definitions at 
http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/guidance-geographies/terms-and-definitions.html for a list of the states that are included in each region and division. All geographic boundaries for the 2018 population estimates series except statistical area delineations are as of January 1, 2018.  The Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan, micropolitan, and combined statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those issued by that agency in August 2017.   An "(X)" in the 2010 Census field indicates a locality that was formed or incorporated after the 2010 Census. Additional information on these localities can be found in the Geographic Boundary Change Notes (see  https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/boundary-change-notes.html).

The 6,222 people in Bedford city, Virginia, which was an independent city as of the 2010 Census, are not included in the April 1, 2010 Census enumerated population presented in the county estimates. In July 2013, the legal status of Bedford changed from a city to a town and it became dependent within (or part of) Bedford County, Virginia. This population of Bedford town is now included in the April 1, 2010 estimates base and all July 1 estimates for Bedford County. Because it is no longer an independent city, Bedford town is not listed in this table. As a result, the sum of the April 1, 2010 census values for Virginia counties and independent cities does not equal the 2010 Census count for Virginia, and the sum of April 1, 2010 census values for all counties and independent cities in the United States does not equal the 2010 Census count for the United States. Substantial geographic changes to counties can be found on the Census Bureau website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html.
