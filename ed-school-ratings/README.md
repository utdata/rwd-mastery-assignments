# School accountability ratings

Each year the Texas Education Agency rates public schools based on test scores and other factors. This lesson is based on the 2019 ratings. You will download the data, find the answers to a series of questions and write a short "data drop" about what you learned.

> Note that in 2018 TEA debuted a nice reporting tool at [txschools.gov](https://txschools.gov/). We'll be looking into some questions that can't be answered with this tool alone.

This section will cover downloading and understanding the data. Below you'll find a link to the specified tool to use to find the answers.

## Downloading data

- Start at the [2019 Accountability Ratings site](http://tea.texas.gov/Student_Testing_and_Accountability/Accountability/State_Accountability/Performance_Reporting/2019_Accountability_Rating_System).
- Look for (and use) the [Data Download](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/account/2019/download.html) link.
  - What type of data would you like to download? Choose **Campus-level Data**
  - Subset data by selecting the category of information you wish to download: Choose **Accountability Summary**
  - Select your preferred file type: Choose **Comma-Delimited**
  - Hit the **Continue** button.

This will download a file called `CAMPRATE.dat`. **Rename this file** to `CAMPRATE.csv` (vs the `.dat` extension).

> Note that it is possible to used the Excel download format, but the size of the file is much larger: 20.8 MB vs 3.3 MB. Let's stick with the csv.

- While you are on this screen, open in a new tab the link [Master Reference for Data Elements used in the Accountability System](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/account/2019/download/acctref.html), then find the link for [CAMPRATE](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/account/2019/download/camprate.html) which tells you what each column means.
