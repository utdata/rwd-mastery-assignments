# Public information requests for data

A series of assignments for Reporting with Data. The assignments given will vary by semester.

## Spring 2020

- [Write a draft request](pir-draft.md). You have to think of your own idea and write the draft request for that data.
- [Marijuana arrests](pir-drug-offenses.md). This is a group project where you will submit a PIR to a police agency and negotiate for the data.
